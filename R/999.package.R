#
# \section{Requirements}{
#   This package requires the \pkg{R.oo} package [1].
# } 
#
# \section{Installation}{
#   To install this package, see \url{http://www.braju.com/R/}.
#   Required packages are installed in the same way.
# }
#
# \section{To get started}{
#   For scanner calibration:
#   \enumerate{
#     \item see @see "calibrateMultiscan.matrix" - scan the same array two or more times to calibrate for scanner effects and extended dynamical range.
#   }
#
#   To normalize multiple single-channel arrays all with the same number of probes/spots:
#   \enumerate{
#     \item @see "normalizeAffine.matrix" - normalizes, on the intensity scale,  for differences in offset and scale between channels.
#     \item @see "normalizeQuantileRank.matrix", @see "normalizeQuantileSpline.matrix" - normalizes, on the intensity scale,  for differences in empirical distribution between channels.
#   }
#
#   To normalize multiple single-channel arrays with varying number probes/spots:
#   \enumerate{
#     \item @see "normalizeQuantileRank.list", @see "normalizeQuantileSpline.list" - normalizes, on the intensity scale, for differences in empirical distribution between channels.
#   }
#    
#   To normalize two-channel arrays:
#   \enumerate{
#     \item @see "normalizeAffine.matrix" - normalizes, on the intensity scale, for differences in offset and scale between channels.  This will also correct for intensity-dependent affects on the log scale.
#     \item @see "normalizeCurveFit.matrix" - Classical intensity-dependent normalization, on the log scale, e.g. lowess normalization.
#   }
#
#   To normalize three or more channels:
#   \enumerate{
#     \item @see "normalizeAffine.matrix" - normalizes, on the intensity scale, for differences in offset and scale between channels.  This will minimize the curvature on the log scale between any two channels.
#   }
# }
# 
# \section{Further readings}{
#   Several of the normalization methods proposed in [3]-[6] are 
#   available in this package.
# } 
#
# \section{How to cite this package}{
#   Whenever using this package, please cite [2] as\cr
#
#   @howtocite "aroma.light"
# }
#
# \section{Wishlist}{
#  Here is a list of features that would be useful, but which I have
#  too little time to add myself. Contributions are appreciated.
#  \itemize{
#    \item At the moment, nothing.
#  }
#
#  If you consider to contribute, make sure it is not already 
#  implemented by downloading the latest "devel" version!
