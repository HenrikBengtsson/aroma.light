\description{
  This page contains aliases for all "non-documented" objects that
  \code{R CMD check} detects in this package.

  Almost all of them are \emph{generic} functions that have specific
  document for the corresponding method coupled to a specific class.
  Other functions are re-defined by \code{setMethodS3()} to
  \emph{default} methods. Neither of these two classes are non-documented
  in reality.
  The rest are deprecated methods.
