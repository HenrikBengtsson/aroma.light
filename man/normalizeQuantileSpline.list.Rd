 \title{Normalizes the empirical distribution of a set of samples to a target distribution}

 \usage{\method{normalizeQuantileSpline}{list}(X, xTarget=NULL, ...)}

 \description{
   Normalizes the empirical distribution of a set of samples to a target distribution.  The samples may differ in size.
 }

 \arguments{
   \item{X}{a \code{\link[base]{list}} with \code{\link[base]{numeric}} \code{\link[base]{vector}}s.  The \code{\link[base]{vector}}s may be of
     different lengths.}
   \item{xTarget}{The target empirical distribution.  If \code{\link[base]{NULL}}, the target
     distribution is calculated as the average empirical distribution of
     the samples.}
   \item{...}{Passed to \code{\link{normalizeQuantileSpline.numeric}}().}
 }

 \value{
   Returns a \code{\link[base]{list}} of normalized \code{\link[base]{numeric}} \code{\link[base]{vector}} of the same lengths as the
   corresponding ones in the input matrix.
 }

 \section{Missing values}{
   Missing values are excluded.
   Values that are \code{\link[base]{NA}} remain \code{\link[base]{NA}} after normalization.
   No new \code{\link[base]{NA}}s are introduced.

 \seealso{
   The target empirical distribution is calculated as the average
   using \code{\link[aroma.light:averageQuantile.list]{*averageQuantile}()}.
   Each \code{\link[base]{vector}} is normalized toward this target disribution using
   \code{\link[aroma.light:normalizeQuantileSpline.numeric.list]{*normalizeQuantileSpline.numeric}()}.
