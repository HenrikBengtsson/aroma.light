\title{Sample tuples of elements from a set}

\description{
  Sample tuples of elements from a set.
  The elements within a sampled tuple are unique, i.e. no two elements
  are the same.
}

\usage{\method{sampleTuples}{default}(x, size, length, ...)}

\arguments{
 \item{x}{A set of elements to sample from.}
 \item{size}{The number of tuples to sample.}
 \item{length}{The length of each tuple.}
 \item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[base]{sample}}().}
}

\value{
  Returns a NxK \code{\link[base]{matrix}} where N = \code{size} and K = \code{length}.
