 \description{
   Methods for microarray analysis that take basic data types such as matrices and lists of vectors.  These methods can be used standalone, be utilized in other packages, or be wrapped up in higher-level classes.
 }

 \section{Requirements}{
   This package requires the \pkg{R.oo} package [1].
 }

 \section{Installation}{
   To install this package, see \url{http://www.braju.com/R/}.
   Required packages are installed in the same way.
 }

 \section{To get started}{
   For scanner calibration:
   \enumerate{
     \item see \code{\link{calibrateMultiscan.matrix}}() - scan the same array two or more times to calibrate for scanner effects and extended dynamical range.
   }

   To normalize multiple single-channel arrays all with the same number of probes/spots:
   \enumerate{
     \item \code{\link{normalizeAffine.matrix}}() - normalizes, on the intensity scale,  for differences in offset and scale between channels.
     \item \code{\link{normalizeQuantileRank.matrix}}(), \code{\link{normalizeQuantileSpline.matrix}}() - normalizes, on the intensity scale,  for differences in empirical distribution between channels.
   }

   To normalize multiple single-channel arrays with varying number probes/spots:
   \enumerate{
     \item \code{\link{normalizeQuantileRank.list}}(), \code{\link{normalizeQuantileSpline.list}}() - normalizes, on the intensity scale, for differences in empirical distribution between channels.
   }
  
   To normalize two-channel arrays:
   \enumerate{
     \item \code{\link{normalizeAffine.matrix}}() - normalizes, on the intensity scale, for differences in offset and scale between channels.  This will also correct for intensity-dependent affects on the log scale.
     \item \code{\link{normalizeCurveFit.matrix}}() - Classical intensity-dependent normalization, on the log scale, e.g. lowess normalization.
   }

   To normalize three or more channels:
   \enumerate{
     \item \code{\link{normalizeAffine.matrix}}() - normalizes, on the intensity scale, for differences in offset and scale between channels.  This will minimize the curvature on the log scale between any two channels.
   }
 }

 \section{Further readings}{
   Several of the normalization methods proposed in [3]-[6] are
   available in this package.

 \section{Wishlist}{
  Here is a list of features that would be useful, but which I have
  too little time to add myself. Contributions are appreciated.
  \itemize{
    \item At the moment, nothing.
  }

  If you consider to contribute, make sure it is not already
  implemented by downloading the latest "devel" version!
